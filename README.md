#comment: flott at du har med tasks remaining men det er litt som mangler her. anbefaler å sjekke litt på hva som skal være i en README.MD fil.#
Part of this project has been to divy it up in to more managable chunks.

Tasks remaining: #comment: dette kan bli en future improvemt list#
- clean up placement of panel menu
- clicking outside the menu closes it
- API map
- chatbot
   - async/await response
- API key usage info in the readme
- "add to basket" button on main page
- resize the pixels for THIS IS HOW IT WORKS up to 788px
- update readme file, examples ( Title, table of content, features, technologies used, set up instructions, AI integration, development process, future improvemnts and Author.)

Chatbot, the way I have set up the API key, cannot be used in the run option page provided through Visual Studio Code. Troubleshooting through other programs have been done to test the setup.
