Part of this project has been to divy it up in to more managable chunks.

Tasks remaining:
- clean up placement of panel menu
- clicking outside the menu closes it
- API map
- chatbot
   - async/await response
- API key usage info in the readme
- "add to basket" button on main page
- resize the pixels for THIS IS HOW IT WORKS up to 788px

Chatbot, the way I have set up the API key, cannot be used in the run option page provided through Visual Studio Code. Troubleshooting through other programs have been done to test the setup.
