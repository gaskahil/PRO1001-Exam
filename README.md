SETUP:
Before testing the chatbot, make sure you open the script folder and chatbot.js file. At the top of the js file, you can update where the OpenAI is imported from, and your API key.

Gave me a nice push for how to start setting up the google maps API

Part of this project has been to divy it up in to more managable chunks.

Tasks remaining:
- clean up placement of panel menu
- clicking outside the menu closes it
- API map
- chatbot
   - async/await response
- API key usage info in the readme
- "add to basket" button on main page
- resize the pixels for THIS IS HOW IT WORKS up to 788px

Chatbot, the way I have set up the API key, cannot be used in the run option page provided through Visual Studio Code. Troubleshooting through other programs have been done to test the setup.
